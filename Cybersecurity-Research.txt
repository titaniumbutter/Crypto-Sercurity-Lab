In 2012, a Russian Hacker acquired a total of 167 million login credentials from LinkedIn. Although the original total of compromised passwords was believed to be 6.5 million, the actual damage of the breach wasn’t revealed until 2016 when millions of passwords were discovered on Motherboard, a dark web marketplace. Although LinkedIn actively encrypted their passwords before the breach, it is believed that the attack was the result of the company’s failure to “salt” the data. To avoid future attacks, LinkedIn has reportedly incorporated this process into their cyber management.
